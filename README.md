# Time Series Projects

Welcome to my Time Series Projects repository! In this collection, you’ll find a variety of projects focused on time series forecasting. These projects showcase different models, approaches, and techniques applied to real-world data. I aim to demonstrate my skills in time series analysis and forecasting through detailed experiments and benchmarking of traditional and modern algorithms.

## Projects

- [Bike Rental Forecasting with Traditional Time Series Models](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Time-Series-Projects/blob/main/Bike%20Rental%20Forecasting%20-%20Traditional%20TS%20Models.ipynb): This project focuses on time series forecasting using the Capital Bikeshare dataset, which captures bike rental patterns in Washington D.C. over a two-year period (2011-2012). The dataset includes temporal variables, calendar-related features, and environmental conditions, with the goal of forecasting the total number of bike rentals. Three classical time series models—SNAIVE, SARIMA, and Facebook Prophet—are applied and benchmarked. The project evaluates their performance, residuals, and metrics, ultimately comparing the models to identify the best performer for bike rental demand forecasting.


- [Multivariate Forecasting of Major Smartphone Stocks](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Time-Series-Projects/blob/main/Multivariate%20Forecasting%20of%20Smartphone%20Stocks.ipynb): This project focuses on multivariate time series forecasting using stock price data of Apple and Samsung from 2016 to 2021. The dataset includes key financial indicators such as open, close, high, low, volume, and adjusted close. Three classical statistical time series models—SARIMAX, Facebook Prophet, and VAR—are applied and evaluated. While SARIMAX and Prophet model Apple and Samsung individually, the VAR model also incorporates Google’s Pixel stock prices to capture interdependencies. Models are compared using residuals and performance metrics to identify the best performer for stock price forecasting.


- [Forecasting Economic Indicators with Multivariate Time Series Models](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Time-Series-Projects/blob/main/Forecasting%20Economic%20Indicators%20-%20Multivariate%20TS%20Models.ipynb): This project focuses on forecasting economic indicators using multivariate time series models with data from the Global Economy dataset. The dataset includes key variables such as GDP, population, employment rate, inflation, and region across countries and regions over multiple decades. For this analysis, specific economic areas are selected, and various time series techniques are applied to model and analyze their economic performance over time. Classical statistical models, including ARIMAX, Facebook Prophet, and VAR, are utilized and benchmarked. While ARIMAX and Prophet focus on individual economic indicators, the VAR model integrates multiple economic variables across countries to capture their interdependencies. The models are compared using residuals and performance metrics to identify the best method for forecasting economic trends.


- [NVIDIA Stock Forecasting via Cross-Sectional Modeling](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Time-Series-Projects/blob/main/NVIDIA%20Stock%20Forecasting%20via%20Cross-Sectional%20Modeling.ipynb): This project leverages the NVIDIA Stock Price dataset, which contains daily stock data from July 28, 2011, to July 27, 2016, sourced from NASDAQ via Yahoo Finance. The focus of the project is to forecast the stock's closing price by transforming the time series data into a cross-sectional supervised learning problem. To achieve this, time-based features are engineered using tsfresh for feature extraction, along with additional manually created features to enrich the model. The project compares the performance of XGBoost and ARIMAX models, evaluating them based on residuals and performance metrics to identify the best approach for stock price forecasting.
