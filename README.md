# Time Series Projects

Welcome to my Time Series Projects repository! In this collection, you’ll find a variety of projects focused on time series forecasting. These projects showcase different models, approaches, and techniques applied to real-world data. I aim to demonstrate my skills in time series analysis and forecasting through detailed experiments and benchmarking of traditional and modern algorithms.

## Projects

- [Bike Rental Forecasting with Traditional Time Series Models](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Time-Series-Projects/blob/main/Bike%20Rental%20Forecasting%20-%20Traditional%20TS%20Models.ipynb): This project focuses on time series forecasting using the Capital Bikeshare dataset, which captures bike rental patterns in Washington D.C. over a two-year period (2011-2012). The dataset includes temporal variables, calendar-related features, and environmental conditions, with the goal of forecasting the total number of bike rentals. Three classical time series models—SNAIVE, SARIMA, and Facebook Prophet—are applied and benchmarked. The project evaluates their performance, residuals, and metrics, ultimately comparing the models to identify the best performer for bike rental demand forecasting.
